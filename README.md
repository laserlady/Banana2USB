# Banana2USB  
Tired of endlessly killing and butchering innocent USB cables just for connecting an external PSU or a multimeter?  
Here's the solution. "Banana2USB" lets You connect a USB device directly via two 4mm banana plugs (proper 19mm apart) to a regular lab power supply or a srandard multimeter. As a benefit You can also connect a logic analyzer or so to the data lines D+ and D-.  
As a caveat, don't expect any high-speed capabilities, the layout is not optimized for higher speeds. I needed a quick-n dirty solution for myself.  
The project is done in Altium Designer. I've added all files that are necessary to order parts and PCB.
